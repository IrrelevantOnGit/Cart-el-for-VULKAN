# 🛒 Data Warehouse for Retail

This project simulates a star-schema data warehouse for a fictional retail company. It includes sales, customers, products, time, and location dimensions designed for analytics and reporting. The warehouse is built using T-SQL and is ideal for running performance-optimized queries and KPIs.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Retail companies must analyze large volumes of transactions to optimize inventory, understand customer behavior, and monitor profitability across regions and time periods. This project structures that raw data into a star schema for fast, reliable querying.

---

## 🧱 Schema Design

The star schema consists of:

- `fact_sales`: central sales transaction table
- `dim_product`: product details
- `dim_customer`: customer demographics
- `dim_store`: location info
- `dim_date`: time dimension

---

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Model schema using ERD principles
2. Generate SQL DDL statements to create tables
3. Populate with sample data
4. Run optimized SQL queries for KPIs
